          <h2> Cocoa's Character </h2>
        </div>

        <p> Cocoa was more than a pet to our faimly, he was a brother and son!
        Cocoa was the best dog a family could ask for. He was truly one of a
        kind.
       </p>

         <h3> What made Cocoa so Special? </h3>
        </div>

       <div class="listBody">
         <ul>
           <li> Loyal to a Fault </li>
              <ul>
                <li> Many accounts Cocoa would lie down on our driveway waiting
                  for mom to come home to return for hours.
                </li>
                <li> Cocoa use to cross country ski with us for hours on end.
                 Eventhough midway through he'd be carrying an extra 5lbs
                 in snowballs attached to his body.
               </li>
             </ul>
             <li>Kind and Friendly</li>
             <ul>
               <li> Cocoa would rarely ever bark and never bite anybody. </li>
             </ul>
             <li> Always Happy </li>
             <ul>
               <li>
                Cocoa had an Aura around him that was unmatched. Even the way
                he walked made it seem like he was happy. I use to call his
                walk "the puddy walk".
